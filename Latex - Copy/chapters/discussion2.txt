In the paper by Rouzbeh Maani, Yee Hong Yang, Sanjay Kalra \cite{Voxel} they propose an alternative method to compute the three-dimensional GLCMs. Instead of identifying the relevant offsets and compute a GLCM for each offset at different distances, they propose creating a sphere around each voxel with the distance used as radius.
The advantage with using offsets compared to the radius computatinal wise is that despite an increase in distance the amount of angles does not increase, the amount of GLCMs to calculate are No. of offsets $\times$ distances, where as if we were to take the radius the No. of offsets at a given distance, increases with the distance, even when we take into account that we can ignore half of the angles. For  the radius the No. of GLCMs to calculate at distance d is equal to $\sigma_{i=1}^d$3$\cdot$i + 1. So for each additional distance one would have to calculate 3*d+1 additional GLCMS if we were using the radius, compared to just the four offsets. These calculations are just for the two-dimensional, where as in three dimensions this problem is amplified, as each increase in distance increases the number of GLCMS by ½((2d+1)$^3$-1).\fixme[inline]{skriv pænt op} However as this clearly demonstrates the radius method would gather a lot more information, but considering that we have over a thousand features for each patients, we are not in need of more information. In addition the subject of this paper is inspired by the paper from Peter A. Freeborough and Nick C. Fox \cite{MRfreeborough}, so we are keeping our method similar to theirs, so it  is possible to compare the results.
