Short intro to what is image texture

\subsection{Co-occurrence matrix}


The co-occurence matrix (COM) is second-order statistics methods, which is based on information about gray levels in pair of pixes. The matrix is defined over the image with distribution values at a given offset. Mathematically we have a COM matrix \textbf{C} which is defined over an $n \times m$ image \textbf{I}, with $\Delta x, \Delta y$ being the parameterized offset, is calculated by

\[
C_{\Delta x, \Delta y}(i, j) = \Sigma_{p=1}^n\Sigma_{q=1}^m
\begin{dcases}
  1, \quad \text{if } I(p,q)=i \text{ and } I(p+\Delta x, q+ \Delta y) =j \\
  0, \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{dcases}
\]
\fxnote[inline]{find reference}

The element (5,4) in the COM can be translated to meaning how many times there exist an element in the image with GI \fxnote[inline]{level or intensity?} 5 and another element offset $\Delta x, \Delta y$ from the originial with greyscale intensity  (GI) 4, i.e. if the offset is (,1) and the first element is {(x,y)(4,3)} with GI 5 it would mean that element (x,y)(5,3) would have GI 4. If COM(4,4) is ten, it translates into there being ten instances with element (x,y) = 5 and (x+$\Delta x$,y+$\Delta y$) = 4.

  \caption{Example how the values in the GLCM are calclulated of the 4-by-5 image I. Element (1, 1) in the GLCM contains the value 1 because there is only one instance inf the image where two horizontally adjacent pixels have the values 1 and 1.}\label{GLCM}
\end{figure}


A single image have multiple COMs as different offsets creates different relations. Consider a 3 $\times$ 3 matrix looking at element (2,2) we can then create eight different offsets, {(1,0),(1,1), (0,1)),(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1)}, however they are not unique. \fxnote[inline]{Lave 3x3 matrice med offsets.}

Focusing on the two offsets {(0,1), (0,-1)} in element (2,2) and (1,2) with GI 1 and 2 respectfully increases the entry COMs$_{1,0}$(1,2) and COMs$_{-1,0}$ (1,1) with one, showing that COMs$_{0,1}$$^\textbf{T}$ = COMs$_{0,-1}$. There exist the same relation between (1,1)(-1,-1), (0,1)(0,-1), and (-1,1)(1,-1). This leaves four different offsets for analysis {(0,1),(-1,1), (-1,0)),(-1,-1)} in general {(0,d),(-d,d),(-d,0),(-d,-d)} where d is the distance which are commonly named angles 0$^\circ$, 45$^\circ$, 90$^\circ$ and 135$^\circ$.
\fxnote[inline]{show 3x3 matrix with angles clearly visible}

The co-occurrence matrix is quadratic with the number of rows and columns equal to the amount of GI, for example if we have 256 GI we get a 256 $\times$ 256 COM.
\fxnote[inline]{Show example on a 5x5 matrix with GI 8, offset [1 0] and [0 1]}

Extending this method to three-dimensions it is necessary to look on how the offsets are defined because the size of the COM is defined by the amount of GIs and not by the images it is derived from. Considering a 3 $\times$ 3 $\times$ 3 matrix we have a possible of 26 offsets. In two-dimensions it is possible to eliminate half of the offsets because of the relation COM$_{d,d}^\textbf{T}$ = COM$_{-d,-d}$, and it is the same case in three-dimensions with the relation being COM$_{d,d,d}^\textbf{T}$ = COM$_{-d,-d,-d}$. This leaves 13 offsets which are illustrated below.\\

\subsection{Texture features from co-occurrence matrix}

\section{Machine learning}
Short intro to Machine learning

\subsection{10-fold cross-validation}
Given a model with unknown paramers and a training set to which the model can be fit then the fitting process optimizes the models parameters to fit the training data. Validating this model against independent data (test data) from the same data pool as the training, it will generally turn out that the model does not fit the test data as well as the training data. It is known as overfitting and is a problem when the size of the training data set is small. Cross-validation is used to counteract overfitting.

Dividing the entire data set into 10 groups at random, one subsample is saved for testing and the reamining nine is used to fit the model. The procedures is done so all subsamples get to be used to validate exactly one time and the validation result can then be averaged to produce a single estimation. This solves the problem of overfitting, as the validation data set is never used in to fit the model.
\fxnote[inline]{how does this remove overfitting?}

\subsection{Feature selection}

Feature selection is the process of selection af subset of relevant features for use in model contruction. When a dataset contains many feautres that are either redundant og irrelevant it is possible to remove them without incurring much loss of information. Features may be redundant due to the pressence of another feature with which it is strongly correlated, while they may be very informative for the model their information have already been provided by a different feature.

\subsection{K-nearest neighbors algorithm}

k-NN for short is a method that is used for classification and regression. Where the output is a class and member of this class, and this object is classified by its neighbors. For instance, if we chose k to 1, then the object will be assigned to the class of the single nearest neighbor.

The algorithm consist of training examples, that are vectors in multidimensional space, with each its label. The most used distance metric is Euclidean distance.

The drawback of k-NN is that classification can be skewed in that way, that the more frequent class tend to dominate the prediction of new examples, because they tend to be common among the k-NN due to their large number.

The way we wish to implement the k-NN in matlab is, first we handle the data, then we will calculate the distance between two data instances and after that, we can locate k most similar data instances and generate a response from a set. After all this is done, we have to summarize the accuracy of predictions.


Dette vil være en lille introduktion til de tools vi bruger til at analysere vores data med. Da vores data er MRI skanninger af hjernen, som er nogen voxels\footnote{noget her} som bliver repræsenteret i 3D.\\



\section{Erode}

Each patients hippocampus has been segmented in the MRI scan. The problems we can run into are that the background will blur with the segmentation i.e. the hippocampus. Performing a erosion can solve this problem and we can focus on the hippocampus, with the maximum number of details. As seen in figure \ref{fig:noterodeslice} the erosion has not been performed yet, but we might have some problems with data surrounding the hippocampus is blurring out the edges of the hippocampus. To solve this, we create a mask to separate the hippocampus from the background data and end up with what is left in figure \ref{fig:erodeslice}

The erosion we have used is called a city-block metric and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:Erosion2D}.

To give an example of how the erosion works, it will be illustrated and we will use the city-block metric for this purpose. So we will use figure \ref{fig:Erosion2D} and erode the image in figure \ref{fig:ErosionExample}.

As seen in figure \ref{fig:ErosionExample} the noise (background) have been removed. This is an example in 2D. Now we wish to extend the erosion city-block to 3D. As seen in figure \ref{fig:Erosion2D} it have 4 neighbours and when we extend this to 3D we will end up with 6 neighbours instead as seen in figure \ref{fig:Erosion3D} and the concept is still the same as in 2D
