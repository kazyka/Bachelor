\chapter{Introduction}

Alzherimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among people and is a growing problem in the aging populations. It has a big impact on health services and society as life expectancy increases.\fxnote[inline]{Hvorfor} AD is the cause in about 60\%-70\% of all cases of dementia\cite{Who} and about 70\% of the risk is believed to be genetic \cite{AlzheimerLancet}. Currently there are no way to cure dementia or to alter the progressive course. But however, much can be done to support and improve the lives if AD is found in the early stage of progression \cite{Who}

In this report we will examine MRI data of the hippocampus using image texture analysis and apply machine learning, for this we have 50 normal controls and 50 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. 

We will be using two different image texture analysis method, one which will me in 2D\cite{MRfreeborough}\cite{Castellano} and the other one will be in 3D\cite{Voxel}, from which we calculate the data to the gray level co-occ\-urren\-ce matrix (GLCM).


%We will focus on a co occurrence matrix both in 2D and 3D and k-NN as machine learning. If we have time, we will try to implement more methods\footnote{\url{http://etd.fcla.edu/CF/CFE0000273/Gadkari_Dhanashree_U_200412_MS.pdf}}

\section{Problem Definition}

Is it possible to classify MRI data of the hippocampus into groups of healthy controls vs Alzheimer's patient, using a predefined set of image texture metrices, with an accuracy great\-er than 80\%?

Will there be a difference in diagnosing AD successfully by calculating the co-occurence matrix in 3D compared to 2D.
