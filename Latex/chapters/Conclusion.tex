\chapter{Conclusion}

Even with a naive feature selection it is possible to get a prediction accuracy greater than 80\% and with more complex feature selections we end up with a better accuracy for the model.

We found no increased prediction accuracy for the 3D methods even though the 3D selects offsets that are unique to the 3D and not accessible for the 2D methods. So with no increased prediction accuracy for the 3D but a heavy computational cost, we would not recommend using a 3D method over the established 2D.
